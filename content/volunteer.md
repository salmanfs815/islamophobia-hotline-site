Are you a lawyer that is interested in making a difference in reducing Islamophobic discrimination? The Islamophobia Legal Assistance Hotline (ILAH) is looking for volunteer lawyers like you to join our mission.  ILAH focuses on various areas of law, including human rights, employment, tenancy, and immigration, with the ultimate goal of combatting Islamophobia and fostering a more inclusive society. However, we welcome lawyers from all practice areas to join our roster. If you&#39;re interested in volunteering, we invite you to complete the [attached form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc-0mzh8GCTi3IpT4Ly59cPugqXlA-AV59nFH98xlHg5sP4pA/viewform).
