Join us for an interactive workshop where Muslim students in the Lower Mainland connect, share their experiences, and discuss the challenges and strengths of navigating school life. Link in the Hotline's bio to register!  

This workshop invites Muslim students to come together in a safe and empowering environment to share personal experiences and learn from one another. Through guided group activities and reflection, participants will discuss themes of identity, resilience, Islamophobia, representation, and belonging. The session aims to amplify student voices and inspire collective action toward more just and inclusive educational spaces. Dinner will be served!
