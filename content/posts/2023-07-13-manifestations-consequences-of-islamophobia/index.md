It is important to acknowledge that Islamophobia does not only occur at the individual level through verbal and physical abuse, but it also manifests at the institutional level. Islamophobia and other forms of oppression are embedded within our systems and normalized. Examples of Islamophobia include hate speech, hate crimes, physical attacks, social, political, and employment discrimination. Islamophobia can also be used to rationalize incarceration, mass surveillance, and disenfranchisement of Muslims and individuals/groups perceived to be Muslim.
