In light of recent events, Canada has seen an upsurge in Islamophobic activities. We request the community to be vigilant of their surroundings and to take extra precautions. If you have been impacted by Islamophobia and require legal advice and/or representation, please call the Islamophobia Legal Assistance Hotline at: 604-343-3828. The Hotline is free, confidential, and available to anyone in British Columbia. Please share and spread the word! If you are a lawyer who would like to volunteer for our program, please fill out the form in our bio. If you have any questions, please email: info@accessprobono.ca
