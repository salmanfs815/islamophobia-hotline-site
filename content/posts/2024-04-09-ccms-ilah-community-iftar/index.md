On March 29th, the Centre for Comparative Muslim Studies and the Islamophobia Legal Assistance Hotline co-hosted a community iftar! We were joined by Sohbi Al-Zobaidi, a Palestinian filmmaker and artist, who shared his experience growing up in Occupied Palestine. Upon breaking our fast, allies from the Independent Jewish Voices and Students for Justice in Palestine also shared a few words, reflecting on the on-going genocide in Palestine. The room was filled with compassion, solidarity, and unity - an evening to remember! Don't forget to keep an eye out for future events.
