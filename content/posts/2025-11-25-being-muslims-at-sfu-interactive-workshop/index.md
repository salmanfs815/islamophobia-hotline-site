Assalamu alaykum  

Our campus community continues to grow, and with that comes the need for spaces where Muslim students can feel heard, understood, and empowered. “Being Muslim at SFU” is an interactive workshop that invites everyone to learn about the challenges Muslim students may face, the realities of Islamophobia, and the many supports available on campus.  

📆 Date: November 28  
🕰️ time: 6:00 pm  
📍Location: SWH 10041 SFU Burnaby

We look forward to welcoming you on November 28 as we learn, connect, and build a more supportive SFU together.
