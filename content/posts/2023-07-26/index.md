We are thrilled to announce that Sabah Ghouse has joined our team as the Program Coordinator of the Islamophobia Legal Assistance Hotline!

Sabah is a passionate advocate and a dedicated scholar whose expertise lies in Equity Studies in Education, with a specific focus on hate crimes and violence against religious minorities, particularly Islamophobia. As a Master's student at SFU, her research delves deep into the complexities of Muslim experiences, unraveling the gendered and racialized dimensions of Islamophobia. Her work highlights the challenges faced by religious minorities and also offers practical solutions to combat religious discrimination and intersecting systems of oppression.

We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to the Law Foundation for their generous funding, which has made it possible for us to bring Sabah on board as the Program Director. Their support has enabled us to enhance our efforts in combating Islamophobia and providing crucial legal assistance to those affected by discrimination.We would also like to extend a special thank you to Access Pro Bono BC for their unwavering support and ongoing partnership with the Islamophobia Legal Assistance Hotline. Their collaboration has been instrumental in advancing our mission of ensuring justice and support for those who face Islamophobia-related challenges.

With Sabah's expertise and dedication, we are confident that the Islamophobia Legal Assistance Hotline will continue to make a meaningful impact in advocating for the rights of religious minorities and addressing the injustices caused by Islamophobia.

As the Program Coordinator, Sabah will play a crucial role in expanding the hotline's outreach efforts to communities affected by Islamophobia.
