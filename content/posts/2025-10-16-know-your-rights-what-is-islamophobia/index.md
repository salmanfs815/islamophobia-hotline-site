The Islamophobia Legal Assistance Hotline and the Canadian Council for Muslim Women is hosting a “Know Your Rights” workshop series designed to provide community members with practical tools to navigate and challenge Islamophobia in everyday life.  

The first session will introduce participants to the concept of Islamophobia, with particular attention to how it is gendered and racialized. Facilitators will explain the Canadian legal framework, including Charter rights, provincial and federal human rights codes, and criminal law protections.
