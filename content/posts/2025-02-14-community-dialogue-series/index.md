On February 11th, ILAH collaborated with @kpumsa and @ccms_sfu to hosted a Community Dialogue Series event, centred around the Quebec Mosque Shooting that occurred in 2017. Thank you to those who attended and shared their experiences about Islamophobia and how we can combat it as a community. Stay tuned for future events!
