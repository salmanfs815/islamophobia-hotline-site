Today, Canada marks the National Day of Remembrance of the Quebec City Mosque Attack and Action Against Islamophobia.

Six years ago, six Muslim men were brutally murdered while praying at the Québec City Mosque. Nineteen others were injured, including one individual who was left paralyzed. The loss to their families and community is profound and immeasurable.

On this day, we honour the lives taken by this heinous act of violence and Islamophobia. I invite you to take a moment to remember them:

Ibrahima Barry
Mamadou Barry
Khaled Belkacemi
Aboubaker Thabti
Abdelkrim Hassane
Azzedine Soufiane

This day is not only about remembrance—it is also a call to action. The National Day of Remembrance serves as a reminder of our collective responsibility to combat Islamophobia, hate, and racism in Canada. Many of us will be wearing a green square to commemorate this day, and I encourage you to do the same.
