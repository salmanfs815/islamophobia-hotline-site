### WHAT IS ISLAMOPHOBIA?

Islamophobia is defined as a fear of and hostility toward Islam and Muslims that proceed from historical Orientalist stereotypes. Islamophobia impacts Muslims and individuals who are perceived as Muslims such as Sikhs, Hindus, and Buddhists. 

As a form of religious oppression, Islamophobia also intersects with other systems of oppression such as sexism and racism. Muslims who are doubly marginalized, such as Muslim women and Black Muslims, are at greater risk of experiencing Islamophobia. Islamophobia is therefore gendered and racialized*. 

Islamophobia manifests at both the individual and institutional level. It can be experienced in the form of hate speech, hate crimes, physical attacks, social, political and employment discrimination, and can be used to rationalize policies such as mass surveillance, incarceration, and disenfranchisement, resulting in the marginalization of Muslims. 

If you have experienced any form of Islamophobia and require legal advice, please [contact us](/contact-us).
