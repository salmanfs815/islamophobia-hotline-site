<h1 id="about-us" class="tc">About ILAH</h1>

Over the past several years, Islamophobia has increased significantly in Canada. In response to the rise of Islamophobia, a group of legal organizations and concerned lawyers in British Columbia established the Islamophobia Legal Assistance Hotline (ILAH or Hotline) in March 2016. Working in solidarity with Muslim and racialized communities, the Hotline aims to combat Islamophobia by providing free legal advice and representation to individuals and groups affected by Islamophobia. Individuals who have experienced Islamophobic discrimination will be assisted by BC lawyers to access available legal remedies.

The Hotline also opposes Islamophobia by providing public legal education, research, and systemic advocacy by working with diverse communities. This may include distribution of educational material, media engagement, community outreach in collaboration with mosques/faith centres, Muslim organizations, and other organizations interested in dismantling Islamophobia and related discrimination.
